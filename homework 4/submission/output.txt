1)Yes, there is overhead for using mutex

2)Spinlock is faster than mutex.The fundamental difference between spinlock and mutex is that spinlock keeps checking the lock (busy waiting), while mutex puts threads waiting for the lock into sleep (blocked). A busy-waiting thread wastes CPU cycles, while a blocked thread does not. However Spinlock is slightly faster than mutex for the same reason.

3)Retrieving can work in parallel.Retrieving an item from the hash table does not require a lock. 

4)If two inserts are being done on different buckets in parallel,then no keys will be lost. For this we can set locks on all those buckets where the updates are being done, so no two threads will go to write and rewrite in the same bucket and hence no keys would be lost.
